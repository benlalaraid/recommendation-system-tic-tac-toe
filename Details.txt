A Minimax algorithm can be best defined as a recursive function that does the following things:

-return a value if a terminal state is found (+10, 0, -10)
-go through available spots on the board
-call the minimax function on each available spot (recursion)
-evaluate returning values from function calls
-and return the best value

To work with the Tic Tac Toe board more easily, you should define it as an array with 9 items.
Each item will have its index as a value.
